## Moving to Object Oriented

We need an Enemy class

What can an Enemy do?

- can shoot
- can die
- should have a point value
- can move
- is a Rect

how to do this?
while creating grid, we need to create new Enemy and based on the current row we define a different point value?

should movement be a separate class? No, cause the movement is not constant throughout the game.
